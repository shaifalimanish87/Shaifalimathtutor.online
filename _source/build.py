  desc="Not sure how to pick an online math tutor? Here are 6 practical things parents should check before booking the first class.",
  body="""
<p>Searching for an online math tutor can feel overwhelming. There are many options, and every tutor promises better marks. These six checks will help you decide with confidence.</p>
<h2>1. Check that the tutor knows your curriculum</h2>
<p>CBSE, ICSE, American Common Core, UK GCSE and Australian syllabi all order topics differently and test in different ways. A tutor who has taught your board will know what the school expects and how exam questions are framed.</p>
<h2>2. Look for one-on-one attention</h2>
<p>In a group class, a child who is confused often stays quiet. In a one-on-one lesson, the tutor sees exactly where the student gets stuck and can change the explanation on the spot.</p>
<h2>3. Ask how the first class works</h2>
<p>A good tutor starts by understanding the child: current grade, weak topics, school marks and goals. If a tutor jumps straight into teaching without asking questions, that is a warning sign.</p>
<h2>4. See how progress is tracked</h2>
<p>You should know what is improving and what still needs work. Ask about practice tests, homework review and regular updates for parents.</p>
<h2>5. Make sure timings suit you</h2>
<p>Families living abroad need a tutor who can work across time zones. Flexible scheduling means fewer missed classes.</p>
<h2>6. Take a free consultation first</h2>
<p>Talk to the tutor before you commit. Notice whether your child feels comfortable asking questions. Comfort matters as much as skill.</p>
<p>If you would like to talk about your child's needs, you can <a href="../contact.html">book a free consultation</a> or <a href="../services.html">see the subjects I teach</a>.</p>"""),

  title="6 Signs Your Child Is Afraid of Math (and How to Help)",
  desc="Math anxiety is common and fixable. Learn the warning signs and simple ways parents can rebuild a child's confidence in math.",
  body="""
<p>Many children say "I'm bad at math" long before they have actually struggled with it. Fear of math usually comes from a few missed basics or a bad experience in class. The good news is that it can be fixed.</p>
<h2>Common signs</h2>
<ul>
<li>They avoid or delay math homework.</li>
<li>They say things like "I can't do it" before even trying.</li>
<li>They hurry to finish without checking the answer.</li>
<li>They feel stomach aches or stress before math tests.</li>
<li>They memorise steps but cannot explain why they work.</li>
<li>Marks in math drop while other subjects stay steady.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How parents can help</h2>
<p><strong>Praise effort, not just marks.</strong> Say "I liked how you kept trying" instead of "You got it right."</p>
<p><strong>Go back to the basics.</strong> Gaps in fractions, tables or negative numbers cause trouble in algebra later. Fixing the base fixes the fear.</p>
<p><strong>Make mistakes normal.</strong> Treat a wrong answer as information about what to learn next.</p>
<p><strong>Use real-life math.</strong> Cooking, shopping and travel plans show children that math is useful.</p>
<p><strong>Get patient support.</strong> A tutor who explains the same idea in different ways, without hurry, can change how a child feels about the subject. Read about <a href="../about.html">my teaching approach</a> or <a href="../contact.html">talk to me</a>.</p>"""),

  title="5 Tips to Make Algebra Easier for Grades 8 to 10",
  desc="Algebra confuses many students because letters replace numbers. These 5 simple tips make equations and expressions easier to understand.",
  body="""
<p>Algebra is the first time many students meet letters in math, and that is where confusion begins. These five habits make the topic much easier.</p>
<h2>1. Treat letters as "mystery numbers"</h2>
<p>A variable like x is just a number we don't know yet. Replace x with a real number now and then to see that the rules are the same as in arithmetic.</p>
<h2>2. Do the same thing to both sides</h2>
<p>An equation is like a balanced scale. Whatever you add, subtract, multiply or divide on one side, do on the other side too.</p>
<h2>3. Write every step</h2>
<p>Skipping steps is the biggest cause of small mistakes, especially with negative signs. Neat, line-by-line working also earns method marks in exams.</p>
<h2>4. Check your answer</h2>
<p>Put the answer back into the original equation. If both sides match, you are right. This builds confidence and catches errors.</p>
<h2>5. Practise a little every day</h2>
<p>Twenty focused minutes daily works better than three hours before the test. Start with easy questions and move up slowly.</p>

  desc="A realistic 4-week math revision plan for school and board exams: what to study each week, how to practise and how to stay calm.",
  body="""
<p>Good exam results come from steady, planned revision, not last-night cramming. Here is a simple plan you can adapt to any board or grade.</p>
<h2>Week 1: List and diagnose</h2>
<p>Write down every chapter in the syllabus. Mark each one green (confident), yellow (okay) or red (weak). Spend the most time on red topics.</p>
<h2>Week 2: Fix the weak topics</h2>
<p>Revisit the concept first, then solve textbook examples, then try exercise questions. Keep a notebook of formulas and common mistakes.</p>
<h2>Week 3: Practise past papers</h2>
<p>Solve at least two full papers under timed conditions. Check your answers and note why you lost marks: concept, calculation or time.</p>
<h2>Week 4: Revise and relax</h2>
<p>Go through your formula notebook, re-do mistakes from earlier papers and sleep well. Avoid learning new topics in the last two days.</p>
<h2>Exam day tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read the whole paper first and start with questions you know.</li>
<li>Show all steps for method marks.</li>
<li>Keep 10 minutes at the end to check.</li>

  title="One-on-One vs Group Math Classes: Which Is Better?",
  desc="Compare one-on-one online math tutoring with group classes on attention, pace, confidence and results, and see which suits your child.",
  body="""
<p>Parents often ask whether a private tutor or a group class is the better choice. Both have a place, but they do different jobs.</p>
<h2>Where one-on-one tutoring wins</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal pace:</strong> The lesson slows down or speeds up with your child.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on gaps:</strong> Time is spent only on topics that need work.</li>
<li><strong>Safe to ask:</strong> Shy students ask doubts freely when no one else is watching.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible timing:</strong> Classes fit around school, sports and time zones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where group classes help</h2>
<p>Group classes can be cheaper and give some peer energy. They work well for students who already understand the basics and need practice, but the pace is fixed for everyone.</p>
<h2>Which should you choose?</h2>
<p>If your child is struggling, has gaps in basics, or is preparing for a board exam, one-on-one is usually more effective. If your child is confident and just needs extra practice, a group class can be enough.</p>
<p>My classes are <a href="../about.html">fully one-on-one</a> and built around the student. <a href="../contact.html">Ask for a free consultation</a> to see if it fits.</p>"""),

    <p>My name is Shaifali Jain, and I am a dedicated and passionate math educator with experience teaching students across different grades and curricula. Helping students who find math intimidating is what I love doing most.</p>
    <p>My goal is simple: to help every student build a strong foundation, gain real confidence, and enjoy learning mathematics rather than fearing it. I believe every student can master math with the right guidance, patience and encouragement.</p>
    <h2>Curricula I Teach</h2>
    <ul class="curriculum-list">
      <li>Indian Curriculum (CBSE / ICSE, Grades 6–10)</li>
      <li>American Curriculum (Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1 &amp; 2, Geometry)</li>
      <li>UK Curriculum (KS2, KS3, GCSE)</li>
      <li>Australian Curriculum &amp; general homework help</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How My Classes Work</h2>
    <p>Lessons are live, one-on-one video sessions on a digital whiteboard. You only need a laptop or tablet, a stable internet connection and a notebook. Timings are flexible across time zones.</p>
